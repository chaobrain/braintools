# Synaptic Connectivity

Comprehensive tools for generating neural connectivity patterns across different types of neural models.

## What you'll find here

- The **fundamental API** and data structures of `braintools.conn`, including `ConnectionResult`, composable operators, and unit handling
- Recipes for **point-neuron connectivity** such as random, distance-dependent, kernel-based, and degree-constrained patterns
- Guidance on wiring **multi-compartment and population abstractions**, using spatial metadata, and layering complex networks
- Best practices for interoperability with simulation backends (BrainState/BrainUnit) and exporting connectivity metadata
